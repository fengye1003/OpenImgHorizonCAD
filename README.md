# ImgHorizon CAD
### 🚀 Project Overview
ImgHorizon CAD (幻域 · CAD) is an AutoCAD plugin library developed using .NET. This library is developed and maintained by HYrecovery from teko.IO SisTemS! and Nanjing Tech University (NJUT/NJTECH). It is positioned as an open-source collection of CAD plugins that integrate modern features, helping architecture students use CAD more efficiently and learn it more easily. This project is also a part of the "COArCHitecture" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project for architecture students.
